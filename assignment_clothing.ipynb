    "Just like in a ROC curve, we go down the sorted (by score or probability) list of samples. We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. We now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",
